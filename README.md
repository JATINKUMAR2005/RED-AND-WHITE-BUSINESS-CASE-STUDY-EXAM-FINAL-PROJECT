## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing airline route profitability using SQL and Power BI. The objective is to help airline management identify profitable routes, cost inefficiencies, demand patterns, and occupancy performance to support data-driven decision making.

The analysis is based on operational, financial, and passenger data for multiple airline routes.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

- Identify most profitable airline routes
- Analyze revenue vs operational cost
- Measure seat occupancy efficiency
- Understand monthly and seasonal profit trends
- Compare route performance by aircraft type and route code

## 📈 Key Business Insights

- The airline generates strong overall profit with efficient cost management.
- Average occupancy rate (~63%) shows unused seat capacity across routes.
- A small number of routes contribute the majority of total profit.
- Some high-revenue routes have high operational costs, reducing margins.
- Clear seasonal trends affect monthly profitability.
- Aircraft type plays a critical role in route performance.
